secretPlains
============

secretPlains is a place that a user can visit to see how their online presence can be interpreted. This is part experiment to see what can be calculated about visitors starting with minimal information, and partially a service which shows users how their presence can be interpreted. Users will be able to provide nothing or allow things such as usernames, phone numbers, or other personal details. As the app grows the options for user input will be expanded. Once user account capabilities are implimented, secretPlains will build a profile so the user can see how their profile grows over time.
