The [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint) definition for a device fingerprint is "<em>information collected about a remote computing device for the purpose of identification. Fingerprints can be used to fully or partially identify individual users or devices even when cookies are turned off.</em>" secretPlains is a place where users can get a sense of what information is in their device fingerprint and examine how it changes over time.
